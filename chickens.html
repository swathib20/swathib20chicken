                The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus domesticus) is a domesticated <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junglefowl">JungleFowl</a> species, with attributes of wild
                species
                such as the grey and the Ceylon junglefowl[1] that are originally from Southeastern Asia. Rooster or
                cock is
                a
                term for an adult male bird, and a younger male may be called a cockerel. A male that has been castrated
                is
                a
                capon. An adult female bird is called a hen and a sexually immature female is called a pullet.
            </p>
            <p>
                Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chickens were not kept for food until the
                Hellenistic period (4th–2nd centuries BC).[2][3] Humans now keep chickens primarily as a source of food
                (consuming both their meat and eggs) and as pets.

            <h2>Terminology</h2>
            <p>
                An adult male is a called a cock or (in the United States) a rooster and an adult female is called a
                hen.[11][12]

                Other terms are:

                Biddy: a newly hatched chicken[13][14]
                Capon: a castrated or neutered male chicken[a]
                Chick: a young chicken<sup><a href="kekekekek">[15]</a></sup>
                Chook /tʃʊk/: a chicken (Australia/New Zealand, informal)[16]
                Cockerel: a young male chicken less than a year old[17]
                Dunghill fowl: a chicken with mixed parentage from different domestic varieties.[18]
                Pullet: a young female chicken less than a year old.[19] In the poultry industry, a pullet is a sexually
                immature chicken less than 22 weeks of age.[20]
                Yardbird: a chicken (southern United States, dialectal)[21]
                Chicken was originally a term only for an immature, or at least young, bird.[when?] In older sources,
                chicken as
                a species were typically referred to as common fowl or domestic fowl.[22][page needed][failed
                verification]

                Chicken may also mean a chick (see for example Hen and Chicken Islands).[23]

        <p>Chickens are gregarious birds and live together in flocks. They have a communal approach to the
            incubation of
            eggs and raising of young. Individual chickens in a flock will dominate others, establishing a 'pecking
            order',
            with dominant individuals having priority for food access and nesting locations. Removing hens or
            roosters
            from
            a flock causes a temporary disruption to this social order until a new pecking order is established.
            Adding
            hens, especially younger birds, to an existing flock can lead to fighting and injury.[34]</p>
        <p>Chickens are omnivores.[28] In the wild, they often scratch at the soil to search for seeds, insects, and
            even
            animals as large as lizards, small snakes,[29] or sometimes young mice.[30]
            The average chicken may live for 5–10 years, depending on the breed.[31] The world's oldest known
            chicken
            lived
            16 years according to Guinness World Records.[32]
            Roosters can usually be differentiated from hens by their striking plumage of long flowing tails and
            shiny,
            pointed feathers on their necks ('hackles') and backs ('saddle'), which are typically of brighter,
            bolder
            colours than those of females of the same breed. However, in some breeds, such as the Sebright chicken,
            the
            rooster has only slightly pointed neck feathers, the same colour as the hen's. The identification can be
            made by
            looking at the comb, or eventually from the development of spurs on the male's legs (in a few breeds and
            in
            certain hybrids, the male and female chicks may be differentiated by colour). Adult chickens have a
            fleshy
            crest
            on their heads called a comb, or cockscomb, and hanging flaps of skin either side under their beaks
            called
            wattles. Collectively, these and other fleshy protuberances on the head and throat are called caruncles.
            Both
            the adult male and female have wattles and combs, but in most breeds these are more prominent in males.
            A
            'muff'
            or 'beard' is a mutation found in several chicken breeds which causes extra feathering under the
            chicken's
            face,
            giving the appearance of a beard.[33]
            Domestic chickens are not capable of long-distance flight, although lighter chickens are generally
            capable
            of
            flying for short distances, such as over fences or into trees (where they would naturally roost).
            Chickens
            may
            occasionally fly briefly to explore their surroundings, but generally do so only to flee perceived
            danger.
